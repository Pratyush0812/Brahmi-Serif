Brahmi Serif is a modern tribute to Indiaâ€™s linguistic and cultural heritage. As English has become a dominant language, many lose touch with their roots. This font seeks to bridge that gap by infusing English with the beauty of ancient Sanskrit. Each letter is designed to remind the reader of the flowing, rhythmic scripts of Sanskrit, while maintaining the familiarity of modern English typography.
